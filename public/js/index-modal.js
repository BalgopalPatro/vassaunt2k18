                  rules: "ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK! We got enough on our plates... \n\n1. The judges' decision is final; any argument with the judges or co-coordinators will result in expulsion from VRoadies.\n2. The Entry into the Personal Interview Round is only possible if the contestants' answers in the questionnaire form are appealing/ offending to the judges and the form checkers.\n3. VRoadies is not for the weak-hearted, if you suffer from any known or unknown physical conditions then we suggest you back the 'eff' off.\n4. The tasks and proceedings in  VRoadies have been set up in a way so as to challenge the participant mentally, physically and emotionally. So don't be a crybaby and start whining if you end up getting abused by anyone.\n5. The Prizes and Rewards will be given only to the winner and if runners up impresses the judges, we really might think of it.\n6. Report immediately to SAC  if you are selected for further rounds, at the given time. We will not hesitate to give your spot to the next valid candidate.\n7. The tasks do involve water and it might get messy, be prepared with clothes that will allow you to perform properly. (An honest advice)\n8. There will be a rapid action first-aid team at all times if at all you get hurt. (In our opinion what's a soldier without a few wounds)\n9. Each task has different difficulty level, if you want you can quit in between.",
